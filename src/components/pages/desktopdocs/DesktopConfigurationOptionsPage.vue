            A lot of the default behaviour of the Unipept Desktop application can be tweaked using the configuration
            options of the app. This document provides an overview of the different configuration options and some
            sensible default values.

                <v-img
                    :src="require('@/assets/documentation/desktop/configuration/desktop_configuration_concurrency.png')"

            </div>

            <p>
                The &quot;Concurrency&quot; section of the configuration options allows you to tweak a number of
                network settings that are used by the Unipept Desktop application. These options typically influence
                the time it takes to perform a single analysis, and the amount of network traffic that is generated
                at one point in time.
            </p>

            <h3>Long running tasks</h3>
            <p>
                A long running task, in this context, is defined as a task that runs in the background and takes longer
                than a few milliseconds to complete. A good example of such a long running task is reading in all of
                the peptides found in an assay file. More than one of these tasks can be executed at the same time, and
                typically require either a lot of processing power, or disk activity. In order to limit the impact of
                Unipept on the rest of your system, you can limit the number of long running tasks that can be executed
                in parallel here. It is recommended to set this value a little bit lower than the number of CPU cores
                that are available on your system. This safeguards the reservation of some spare resources for other
                processes that might require processing power.
            </p>

            <h3>API requests</h3>
            <p>
                This option determines the amount of HTTP-requests that will be performed in parallel to our API-server.
                Setting this to a higher value will typically improve analysis performance. However, setting it too
                high, can cause a bigger load on our server (causing your requests to be delayed). It is recommended
                to set this to a value between 1 and 5.
            </p>

            <h3>Custom endpoints</h3>
            <p>
                If you are using our online service for the analysis of a sample, you are typically using the
                <a href="https://api.unipept.ugent.be">https://api.unipept.ugent.be</a> endpoint. Sometimes, however,
                you might be interested to use a custom endpoint that's set up by a third party. This allows you, for
                example, to use a local instance of the Unipept API-server and avoid sensitive data to be sent over
                the internet. Add custom API-endpoints that adhere to the Unipept API-specification here. You can
                select which endpoint should be used during the analysis of an assay.

            <h3>Database storage location</h3>
            <p>
                All targeted protein reference databases that are constructed by this application need to be stored
                in a specific location. This setting can be used to change the location on the file system of where
                these custom databases will be kept. Note that these files can grow very large in size and that it is
                recommended to keep them on a fast (and preferably large) storage medium (such as an SSD).

            <p>
                Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to run applications in a sandboxed environment.
                This sounds complicated, but means that you can run applications without having to install all of their
                dependencies separately on your system and without having to worry about conflicts with other
                applications. Docker is being used by the Unipept Desktop application for the construction of targeted
                protein reference databases and for running a local instance of the Unipept API.
            </p>

            <v-alert color="warning" outlined>
                <span class="font-weight-bold">Warning:</span>
                Make sure that Docker Desktop is properly installed on your system. Otherwise, the settings for this
                configuration options will not have any effect (and analyses using targeted protein reference
                databases will not work properly). Check <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">this guide</a>
                for a quick explanation on how to install Docker on your system.
            </v-alert>

            <h3>Connection settings</h3>
            <p>
                Unipept Desktop needs to connect to the Docker daemon in order to manage containers and images.
                Normally, the correct default connection settings for your system are used by default. If, however,
                the application is unable to connect to the Docker daemon, then please verify that the settings here
                are correct and adjust where necessary. You can check
                <a href="https://github.com/apocas/dockerode#getting-started">this webpage</a> for more information on
                what configuration values are excepted.
            </p>

            <h3>Docker availability</h3>
            <p>
                By looking at the output presented here, you can verify that the application was able to succesfully
                connect to the Docker daemon. This output is mainly used for debugging purposes and allows you to
                verify the configuration of your Docker installation and what compute resources it has access to.
