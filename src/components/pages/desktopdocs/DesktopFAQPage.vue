                Q: Why does the analysis using a large targeted protein reference database fail on Windows?
            </h3>
            <p>
                A: This is a known issue on Windows that's caused by a default limit on the amount of storage space
                that can be used by Docker on Windows systems. Docker on Windows uses a virtual hard drive (this is
                just a file that's situated somewhere on your machine) that has a fixed, maximum size (by default
                this is 256GiB). This size can be increased by creating a new virtual hard drive and moving all contents
                from the previous one to the one. Doing so is, however, quite technical and is not recommended for
                non-technical users. Instead, we recommend to use a Linux system (such as Ubuntu) or a Mac in this case.
                If you do want to move the virtual hard drive on Windows, you can follow the steps in

                Q: Is Docker always required when using the Unipept Desktop application?
            </h3>
            <p>
                A: No, a valid Docker installation is only required when you want to use a targeted protein reference
                during your metaproteomic analyses.

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Q: What happens when my internet connection drops during an analysis?</h3>
            <p>
                A: If some part of the analysis fails due to a dropped internet connection, the application will keep
                track of the peptides that were not processed and will try again after a few minutes. If the connection
                is still not working by then, the analysis will fail completely and you will be notified. As long
                as the internet connection only drops for a short period of time, the analysis will recover from this
                and finish without issues.
            </p>
            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">
                Q: Does the application need to restart from scratch when an analysis fails after a few minutes?
            </h3>
            <p>
                A: No. The application will keep previously processed analysis results for some time. If you restart
                the analysis after a failure, the application will try to recover the results that were already
                processed and will restart from the point where it last stopped.
