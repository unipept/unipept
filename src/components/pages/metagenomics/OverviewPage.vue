            The <Initialism>UMGAP</Initialism> is a collection of command line tools. Combine them into your own pipeline to identify 
            (short) shotgun metagenomics reads guided by our <RLink to="/umgap/casestudies" router>case studies</RLink>, or use one of the 
            preconfigured pipelines. After each read is assigned a taxon, collect the results in frequency tabels and interactive 
            visualizations. With communication via <i>standard input</i> and <i>standard output</i>, and an easy to understand, 
            consistent intermediate format, it's easy to plug your own extensions into the pipeline.

            Throughout this documentation, the term peptides is used for both tryptic peptides and k-mers. The term taxon ID refers to an 
            identifier of an NCBI taxonomy (which should be the same version in the whole pipeline).

                To use <Initialism>UMGAP</Initialism>, Rust needs to be installed on your system. We recommend the lastest version, 
                but all versions since Rust 1.35 are supported. To check if you have the correct Ruby version installed, open a terminal 
                and run <Code>rustc --version</Code>.
            </p>

                <p>
                    If the <Code>rustc --version</Code> command returns <i>command not found</i>, Rust is not yet installed on your system. More

            <p>
                The next step is to download the UMGAP source code. The easiest way to do this, is by cloning our git repository using 
                <Code>git clone https://github.com/unipept/umgap.git</Code>. Alternatively, you can also click the download button on 
                <RLink to="https://github.com/unipept/umgap">Github</RLink>.

            <p>
                Next, we're ready to compile and install <Initialism>UMGAP</Initialism>. First navigate to the directory where you cloned 
                or downloaded the code, then run <Code>cargo install --path .</Code>. The output should look like this:

                After successful installation, the <Initialism>UMGAP</Initialism> command should be available. To check if it was

                To update <Initialism>UMGAP</Initialism>, simply repeat the install instructions and be sure to redownload the source code. The

                If you want to use FragGeneScanPlusPlus as gene predictor, this needs to be installed as well. Instructions can be 
                found at <RLink to="https://github.com/unipept/FragGeneScanPlusPlus">https://github.com/unipept/FragGeneScanPlusPlus</RLink>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Run the configuration script at <Code>scripts/umgap-setup.sh</Code> to interactively configure <Initialism>UMGAP</Initialism> 
                and download the data files required for some steps of the pipeline.
            </p>

            <p>
                Depending on which type of analysis you are planning, you will need the tryptic index file (less powerfull, but runs on 
                any decent laptop) and the 9-mer index file (uses about 100GB disk space for storage and as much RAM during operation. 
                The exact size depends on the version.)
            </p>

            <p>
                To check if the configuration was successful, you can run a sample analysis with some include test data. The following 
                command should show you a <Initialism>FASTA</Initialism>-like file with a taxon ID per header.
