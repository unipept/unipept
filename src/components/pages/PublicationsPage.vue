                Metaproteomics has become an important research tool to study microbial systems, which has resulted in increased 
                metaproteomics data generation. However, efficient tools for processing the acquired data have lagged behind. One 
                widely used tool for metaproteomics data interpretation is Unipept, a web-based tool that provides, among others, 
                interactive and insightful visualizations. Due to its web-based implementation, however, the Unipept web application 
                is limited in the amount of data that can be analyzed. In this manuscript we therefore present Unipept Desktop, a desktop 
                application version of Unipept that is designed to drastically increase the throughput and capacity of metaproteomics 
                data analysis. Moreover, it provides a novel comparative analysis pipeline and improves the organization of experimental 
                data into projects, thus addressing the growing need for more efficient and versatile analysis tools for metaproteomics 
                data.

                Unipept is an ecosystem of tools developed for fast metaproteomics data-analysis consisting of a web application, a 
                set of web services (application programming interface, <Initialism>API</Initialism>) and a command-line interface (<Initialism>CLI</Initialism>). After the successful 
                introduction of version 4 of the Unipept web application, we here introduce version 2.0 of the <Initialism>API</Initialism> and <Initialism>CLI</Initialism>. Next to the 
                existing taxonomic analysis, version 2.0 of the <Initialism>API</Initialism> and <Initialism>CLI</Initialism> provides access to Unipept’s powerful functional analysis 
                for metaproteomics samples. The functional analysis pipeline supports retrieval of Enzyme Commission numbers, Gene 
                Ontology terms and InterPro entries for the individual peptides in a metaproteomics sample. This paves the way for 
                other applications and developers to integrate these new information sources into their data processing pipelines, which 
                greatly increases insight into the functions performed by the organisms in a specific environment. Both the <Initialism>API</Initialism> and 
                <Initialism>CLI</Initialism> have also been expanded with the ability to render interactive visualizations from a list of taxon ids. These 
                visualizations are automatically made available on a dedicated website and can easily be shared by users.

                Unipept is a web application for metaproteome data analysis, with an initial focus on tryptic-peptide-based biodiversity 
                analysis of <Initialism>MS/MS</Initialism> samples. Because the true potential of metaproteomics lies in gaining insight into the expressed 
                functions of complex environmental samples, the 4.0 release of Unipept introduces complementary functional analysis 
                based on <Initialism>GO</Initialism> terms and <Initialism>EC</Initialism> numbers. Integration of this new functional analysis with the existing biodiversity analysis 
                is an important asset of the extended pipeline. As a proof of concept, a human faecal metaproteome data set from 15 
                healthy subjects was reanalyzed with Unipept 4.0, yielding fast, detailed, and straightforward characterization of 
                taxon-specific catalytic functions that is shown to be consistent with previous results from a <Initialism>BLAST</Initialism>-based functional 
                analysis of the same data.

                In recent years, shotgun metaproteomics has established itself as an important tool to study the composition of complex 
                ecosystems and microbial communities. Two key steps in metaproteomics data analysis are the inference of proteins from 
                the identified peptides, and the determination of the taxonomic origin and function of these proteins. This tutorial 
                therefore introduces the Unipept command line interface (<RLink to="/clidocs" router>http://unipept.ugent.be/clidocs</RLink> ) 
                as a platform-independent tool for such metaproteomics data analyses. First, a detailed overview is given of the 
                available Unipept commands and their functions. Next, the power of the Unipept command line interface is illustrated 
                using two case studies that analyze a single tryptic peptide, and a set of peptides retrieved from a shotgun 
                metaproteomics experiment, respectively. Finally, the analysis results obtained using these command line tools are 
                compared with the interactive taxonomic analysis that is available on the Unipept website.

                The Unique Peptide Finder is an interactive web application to quickly hunt for tryptic peptides that are unique to a 
                particular species, genus, or any other taxon. Biodiversity within the target taxon is represented by a set of proteomes 
                selected from a monthly updated list of complete and nonredundant UniProt proteomes, supplemented with proprietary 
                proteomes loaded into persistent local browser storage. The software computes and visualizes pan and core peptidomes as 
                unions and intersections of tryptic peptides occurring in the selected proteomes. In addition, it also computes and 
                displays unique peptidomes as the set of all tryptic peptides that occur in all selected proteomes but not in any UniProt 
                record not assigned to the target taxon. As a result, the unique peptides can serve as robust biomarkers for the target 
                taxon, for example, in targeted metaproteomics studies. Computations are extremely fast since they are underpinned by the 
                Unipept database, the lowest common ancestor algorithm implemented in Unipept and modern web technologies that facilitate 
                in-browser data storage and parallel processing.

                Unipept is an open source web application that is designed for metaproteomics analysis with a focus on interactive 
                datavisualization. It is underpinned by a fast index built from UniProtKB and the <Initialism>NCBI</Initialism> taxonomy that enables quick 
                retrieval of all UniProt entries in which a given tryptic peptide occurs. Unipept version 2.4 introduced web services 
                that provide programmatic access to the metaproteomics analysis features. This enables integration of Unipept 
                functionality in custom applications and data processing pipelines. Availability and Implementation The web services 
                are freely available at <RLink to="http://api.unipept.ugent.be">http://api.unipept.ugent.be</RLink>> and are open

                The Unipept web application (<RLink to="/" router>http://unipept.ugent.be</RLink>) supports biodiversity analysis of 
                large and complex metaproteome samples using tryptic peptide information obtained from shotgun <Initialism>MS/MS</Initialism> experiments. Its 
                underlying index structure is designed to quickly retrieve all occurrences of a tryptic peptide in UniProt entries. 
                Taxon-specificity of the tryptic peptide is successively derived from these occurrences using a novel lowest common 
                ancestor approach that is robust against taxonomic misarrangements, misidentifications, and inaccuracies. Not taking 
                into account this identification noise would otherwise result in drastic loss of information. Dynamic treemaps visualize 
                the biodiversity of metaproteome samples, which eases the exploration of samples with highly complex compositions. 
                The potential of Unipept to gain novel insights into the biodiversity of a sample is evaluated by reanalyzing publicly 
                available metaproteome data sets taken from the bacterial phyllosphere and the human gut.
