A good example of such a long running task is reading in all of the peptides found in an assay file. More than one of these tasks can be executed at the same time, and typically require either a lot of processing power, or disk activity. In order to limit the impact of Unipept on the rest of your system, you can limit the number of long running tasks that can be executed in parallel here. It is recommended to set this value a little bit lower than the number of CPU cores that are available on your system. This safeguards the reservation of some spare resources for other processes that might require processing power.
