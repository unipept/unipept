",-1),u=e("p",null,[s(" A: This is a known issue on Windows that's caused by a default limit on the amount of storage space that can be used by Docker on Windows systems. Docker on Windows uses a virtual hard drive (this is just a file that's situated somewhere on your machine) that has a fixed, maximum size (by default this is 256GiB). This size can be increased by creating a new virtual hard drive and moving all contents from the previous one to the one. Doing so is, however, quite technical and is not recommended for non-technical users. Instead, we recommend to use a Linux system (such as Ubuntu) or a Mac in this case.

",-1),m=e("p",null," A: If some part of the analysis fails due to a dropped internet connection, the application will keep track of the peptides that were not processed and will try again after a few minutes. If the connection is still not working by then, the analysis will fail completely and you will be notified. As long as the internet connection only drops for a short period of time, the analysis will recover from this and finish without issues.
