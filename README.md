# Unipept

The [Unipept web application](http://unipept.ugent.be) supports biodiversity analysis of large and complex metaproteome samples.
The 2.2 release of Unipept has 4 main features:
* Single peptide analysis

* Peptidome clustering

If you're willing to get your hands dirty, you might of course also send us a pull request!

## Installation

This application is deployed and fully functional at [unipept.ugent.be](http://unipept.ugent.be).
If for some reason you wish to run your own instance, you can do so by deploying this rails application and setting up a database.
This isn't straightforward and you'll probably want some help, so contact us at [unipept@ugent.be](mailto:unipept@ugent.be) before you attempt an installation.

A more user friendly way to set up your own Unipept instance is planned for the next release.
We will probably use [docker](https://www.docker.io/) for this, and release a ready made database as a separate download.
