The [Unipept web application](http://unipept.ugent.be) supports biodiversity and functional analysis of large and complex metaproteome samples and the analysis of peptidomes.

The 4.0 release of Unipept brings functional analysis to the tool.

An [API](https://unipept.ugent.be/apidocs) and [command line tool](http://github.com/unipept/unipept-cli) are available
for integration in other programs.

## Contributing

Found a bug or have an idea for an awesome new feature?
File an issue using the github [issue tracker](https://github.com/unipept/unipept/issues) or drop us a line at [unipept@ugent.be](mailto:unipept@ugent.be).

If you're willing to get your hands dirty, you might of course also send us a pull request!

## Installation

This application is deployed and fully functional at [unipept.ugent.be](http://unipept.ugent.be).
If for some reason you wish to run your own instance, you can do so by deploying this rails application and setting up a database.
This isn't straightforward and you'll probably want some help, so contact us at [unipept@ugent.be](mailto:unipept@ugent.be) before you attempt an installation.

A more user friendly way to set up your own Unipept instance is planned for the future.
We will probably use [docker](https://www.docker.io/) for this, and release a ready made database as a separate download.
