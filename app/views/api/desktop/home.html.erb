      The homepage is the first thing you'll see after you start the application. It provides the ability to create
      a new project, open an existing project or take a tour of the app using the demo project.

      Before you can start to analyse a sample, you need to create a new project. Every project is a collection of
      studies and every study is a collection of assays (that directly correspond to samples). Projects that have been
      created earlier on can be reopened from the &quot;recent projects&quot; list. We plan to provide support to import
      projects that are based upon the ISA-tab model later on. This is however not yet the case.

          A few things are automatically set up the first time you start this application. You will directly notice a
          dialog popping up that downloads a small SQLite-database. This database contains static information about
          taxa and functional annotations. Every month, a new release of this database is automatically generated.
          Unipept Desktop will regularly check for a new version of this database and update it in the background.

        <div>
          Installation for this static database can take up to a few minutes, depending on the downlink of your
          internet connection. The application will continue to work if the installation fails for some reason, it will
          only take longer before analysis results are available. A new attempt to install the database will be made
          when you restart the application.
